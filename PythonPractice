#1. List manipulation (loops, if-else, for-each):

#Even/Odd Separator:
#This code uses an array of numbers 1-9 then sees if they are even or odd
#By using the modulus feature and seeing the remainder when divided by 2
#Then it asigns the number it tested to even or odd then prints them
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
evens = []
odds = []
print("This is the original array:")
print(numbers)

for x in numbers:  
    if x % 2 == 0:
        evens.append(x)
    if x % 2 == 1:
        odds.append(x)
print("These are the odd values in the array:")
print(odds)
print("These are the even values in the array:")
print(evens)
print()



#Number Statistics:
#This code loops through an array then adds each value to a number
#Then it prints the final number to get the sum
sumNumbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13] 
sum2 = 0
for x in sumNumbers:
    sum2= sum2+x
print("the sum of the list is:") 
print(sum2)

#This code finds the length, the amount of numbers, in the array list
#Then is divides te\he sum by the length to get the average
avg=0
length = len(sumNumbers)
avg = sum2/length
print("The average of the list is ")
print(avg)

#This code uses the built in max function and sets it equal to y
#then it prints y
#W3school showed me the syntax for the max function
y=max(sumNumbers)
print("The max value is ")
print(y)

#This code uses the min function then prints the min value
v=min(sumNumbers)
print("The minimum value of the list is ")
print(v)
print()



#Element Finder:
#this code looks through an array called lists
#It sees if the number 28 is an element in the array
#It either prints that it is in the list or it isn't
list = [1,4,5,6,8,9,2,67,87,43]

x=28
print("The number we are testing is ")
print(x)

if x in list:
    print("The number is in the list")
else:
    print("The number is not in the list")
print()




#2. String manipulation (for-each, loops):

#Vowel/Consonant Counter:
#This code uses a forloop to go through each character in String
#Then it sees if the characters have a vowel or consonant
#Then it adds them to the count and prints the count at the end
String = "Birds are cool"
Vowels = "a,e,i,o,u,A,E,I,O,U"
Consonants = "s,S,z,Z,x,X,c,C,v,V,b,B,n,N,m,M,l,L,k,K,j,J,h,H,g,G,f,F,d,D,q,Q,w,W,r,R,t,T,y,Y,p,P"
vowelCount = 0
consonantsCount = 0

for char in String:
    if char in Vowels:
        vowelCount = vowelCount+1
    elif char in Consonants:
        consonantsCount = consonantsCount+1

print("There are " + str(consonantsCount) + " consonants and " + str(vowelCount) + " vowels in the string: " + String)
print()


#Palindrome Checker:
#This code has a string and then reverses the string
#It sets the reversed string equal to text and then checks to see if text is equal to String
#If they are equal, the string is a palindrome and vice versa
String = "racecar"
text = String[::-1]
if text == String:
    print("The string: " + String + " is a palindrome")
else:
    print ("The string: " + String + " is not a palindrome")
print()





#3. Data analysis (lists, dictionaries):

#Student Grade Analysis:
students = [ {"name": "Alice", "grades": [85, 90, 78]}, 
            {"name": "Bob", "grades": [95, 82, 98]}, 
            {"name": "Charlie", "grades": [70, 85, 92]} ]
for student in students:
     averageGrade = 0
     averageGrade=((sum(student["grades"]))/len(student["grades"]))
     print(student.get("name")+ " has an average grade of " + (str(averageGrade)))
     print()


#Movie Rating Analysis:
movies = [ {"title": "The Shawshank Redemption", "genre": "Drama", "rating": 9.3}, 
          {"title": "The Godfather", "genre": "Crime", "rating": 9.2}, 
          {"title": "The Dark Knight", "genre": "Action", "rating": 9.0}, 
          {"title": "Pulp Fiction", "genre": "Crime", "rating": 8.9}, 
          {"title": "Schindler's List", "genre": "Drama", "rating": 8.9} ]

rating = 0
for movie in movies:
    if movie.get("rating") > rating:
        rating = movie.get("rating")
        title = movie["title"]
        genre = movie["genre"]

print("The movie with highest rating: movie name: " + str(title)+ " genre: " + str(genre) + ", rating: " + str(rating))
print()
